1- Using the "read.table" function I imported a dataset in .txt format in R. in this regard I called the file by giving the path of the directory containing thid dataset
2- The package "plyr" allows us to categorize our data to major groups and here we categorized them based on gender and calculated the average.mean for each gender separately. The very handy function for this means is "ddply"
3- The output file generated using write.table (write.csv also works). and path and the format for the output file was given in write.table()
4- We then extracted names containing i or I into a new date set using subset() function and grep argument. This new dataset was written in to a new file in .csv format with separated columns by comma.
